Pulse is an open source tool for the formal 
verification of Java specifications with typestates and access 
permissions. Pulse translates Plural specifications into 
semantically equivalent abstract state machines and 
uses the high-performance evmdd-smc symbolic 
model-checker to exhaustively analyze the specifications. 
The analysis performed by Pulse focuses on three aspects of 
concurrency: deadlocks, unreachable code, and method parallelism.
Pulse has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in 
for the Plural tool from Carnegie Mellon University,
and is freely available on-line.
